                The owner maintains no relationship whatsoever with these platforms and does not share
                private information with them about its users. Access to these social networks through the
                website may involve user authentication on said social network, and AsoPMR therefore
                does not control this environment.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold">4. Social Networks</p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold">6. Responsibility</p>
            <p class="paragraph-normal">The owner disclaims any responsibility derived from any
                damage that the user, or consequently any third party, may suffer, caused by the access and
                use of the website, by the impossibility of access, by relying on the information provided therein
                or by accessing third-party pages subject to redirection.</p>

                viruses and/or other harmful components, and force majeure circumstances that influence the
                continuity of the website or may cause damage to users.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-normal">In any case, AsoPMR has made all necessary efforts to
                keep the website updated, with reliable and quality information, as well as secure and in
                continuous operation, adopting all necessary measures from a legal-organizational and technical point of view.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-normal">If the user considers that there is any content on the website that
                could be contrary to the law, or has suspicions of non-compliance with any of the points
                of these conditions, we ask you to notify us immediately through the established contact channels.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold">7. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</p>
            <p class="paragraph-normal">For the resolution of any litigation related to this
                website, Spanish law in force at the time of the dispute will apply, to which the
                parties expressly submit, with the Courts and Tribunals of the city of Murcia being competent

                this reason.</p>
